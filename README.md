## Funcitonality 

- Create and manage multiple Pokemon teams with ease.
- Save your team compositions for later reference or share them with friends and the wider community. Collaborate with others to tune your strategies and sharpen your overall team-building skills.

## Icebox Features

- Want to add editabilty for teams and reviews
- Want to add a way to differentiate teams to a specific user so that only that user can delete or edit
- Intially I wanted to use PokeAPI to show information specific to the Pokemon a user added to their teams, however I was unable to figure out how to do so in the allotted time and would like to eventually have such a thing added to the project.
    - For example users can select from a dropdown of Pokemon instead of manually typing as well
    - Users would also be able to see sprites for their selected team
