## Funcitonality 

- Users can log-in with their Google account in order to create a Pokemon team to plan out their next journey.
- Once a team is created, users can post their team and allow for other users to view and comment/review them.

## Icebox Features

- Want to add editabilty for teams and reviews
- Want to add a way to differentiate teams to a specific user so that only that user can delete or edit
- Intially I wanted to use PokeAPI to show information specific to the Pokemon a user added to their teams, however I was unable to figure out how to do so in the allotted time and would like to eventually have such a thing added to the project.
    - For example users can select from a dropdown of Pokemon instead of manually typing as well
    - Users would also be able to see sprites for their selected team
